# Light client for EspoCRM

## Why do this?

I have an old mobile phone. A Samsumg that runs Android 2.3. I know, it is very old. But it is what I have and use daily. The default Android browser does not run EspoCRM interface. It is much JavaScript for him. So I created this client makes all queries on the server and avoid code from running in the browser.


## Philosophy

Keep it as simple and functional as possible. Fast to create. Not a priority process data. Show JSON is fine. Without JavaScript. Only essential CSS. Few lines of code. Only ~~one~~ two files (for copy and paste into the server)
